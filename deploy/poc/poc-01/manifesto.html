      <h1>Manifesto</h1>
      <p class="tagline">Our line in the sand. Our theory of change. Our refusal to comply with hype.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>We Believe</h2>
    <p>
      That artificial intelligence must be more than marketing speak. It must be provable, interpretable, and useful in the real world.
    </p>
    <p>
      That open research beats closed hype. That reproducibility is not optional. That models are not magic, and must be measured, critiqued, and improved.
    </p>

    <h2>We Reject</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The cult of inflated parameter counts.</li>
      <li>AI-as-a-service that hides bias behind APIs.</li>
      <li>Foundational models with no foundation.</li>
      <li>Academic elitism divorced from real-world impact.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>We Build</h2>
    <p>
      Tools that work. Code that is understood. Pipelines that scale. Experiments that can be replicated. Systems that are auditable. Research that matters.
    </p>

    <h2>We Align With</h2>
    <p>
      The open-source ecosystem. Scientific publishing. Small teams doing real work. Engineers who refuse mediocrity. Public institutions that seek clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We align with the builders, the skeptics, and the seekers of truth in a field clouded by buzzwords.
    </p>

    <h2>We Are Zinnia Labs</h2>
    <p>
      Not a brand. Not a business unit. A mindset. A research lab. A public declaration that artificial intelligence can, and must, be done differently.
